title: High‑Performance, Secure Web App Architecture --- PokeAPI
  Integration
---

# 1) Overview

This document unifies modern best practices for a high‑traffic
web/mobile app that connects to an API, tailored to the PokeAPI. It
incorporates security‑by‑default, API performance optimization,
GraphQL/BFF patterns, robust UX wireframes, deployment/ops, and an
implementation checklist.

# 2) System Architecture (Edge → BFF → Services → Data)

\- Client: Web (SSR/ISR/CSR) and Mobile (offline‑capable caches)\
- Edge: CDN + WAF, TLS 1.3, HTTP/3, bot mgmt, rate limits, image
optimization\
- BFF (Backend‑for‑Frontend): on same eTLD as web; HttpOnly cookie
sessions (web) / short‑lived tokens (mobile)\
- API Gateway: AuthN/Z enforcement, schema validation, quotas, circuit
breakers, idempotency keys\
- Services: Modular monolith or microservices; mTLS via service mesh;
async workers for heavy jobs\
- Data: Postgres (RLS) for app data; Redis (cache/queue); Object
storage; optional search index\
- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs; SIEM; dashboards
with p50/p95/p99 latency

# 3) Security by Default

\- Web sessions in HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies; prefer
WebAuthn/passkeys + OIDC for first‑party auth\
- CSRF tokens for unsafe methods; strict CSP (nonces) + Trusted Types;
no tokens in localStorage\
- Input validation with JSON schemas (gateway + service); output
encoding by context\
- Service‑to‑service mTLS; least‑privilege IAM; secrets in KMS/Secret
Manager, rotated regularly\
- File uploads: MIME/type/size checks, AV scan, signed URLs, private by
default\
- Authorization: RBAC/ABAC policy‑as‑code; DB row‑level security for
tenants\
- Transport/storage encryption; field‑level crypto for sensitive PII\
- Supply chain: lockfiles, dep scan, SBOM, container signing (Sigstore),
provenance (SLSA)

# 4) API Performance Optimization

\- Edge caching (Cache‑Control, ETag), stale‑while‑revalidate; early
hints (103), preconnect/preload\
- SSR/ISR streaming for fast TTFB; code‑splitting, tree‑shaking; defer
non‑critical JS\
- Caching strategy: L1 in‑proc, L2 Redis (explicit TTLs; keys scoped by
tenant/user)\
- Async jobs via queue; background prefetchers for hot data; 202
Accepted for long tasks\
- Read replicas; connection pooling; request hedging; backoff + jitter;
circuit breakers\
- Idempotency keys for POST/PUT to avoid duplicate side‑effects on
retries

# 5) PokeAPI Primer (facts)

• Base URL (REST v2): https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ --- resources follow
/{endpoint}/{id\|name}/. Lists are paginated by default (20 items) via
limit & offset. Calling an endpoint without an ID returns a paginated
list. \[docs\]

• GraphQL: A free, rate‑limited beta endpoint is available at
https://graphql.pokeapi.co/v1beta2 (POST only) and is subject to change.
\[GraphQL docs\]

• Fair use & rate limits: PokeAPI encourages caching; some sources note
no hard server‑side throttling, but you should implement your own rate
limiting and caching to reduce load. \[fair‑use notes\]

# 6) Integration Design (BFF‑first)

\- All client requests hit your BFF; the BFF calls PokeAPI. No keys are
required for REST; for GraphQL beta, treat as external dependency with
retries.\
- Redis cache for hot endpoints with conservative TTLs (e.g., 6--24h for
static resources like species/types; 1--6h for lists). Invalidate on
schema/version changes if detected.\
- Global token‑bucket limiter (per user/tenant + global) to avoid
hammering PokeAPI; exponential backoff on 5xx/429.\
- Normalize domain filters → PokeAPI params (e.g., lists use
limit/offset; more complex filters are client‑side using cached data).

# 7) REST Endpoints & Examples

List Pokémon (paginated):

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=60&offset=0\
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=60&offset=60

Get Pokémon by name/ID:

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu

Species details (evolution_chain URL is here):

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/25

Evolution chain:

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/10

Types and moves:

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/electric\
GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/thunderbolt

Sprites: within the Pokémon payload
(sprites.other\[\'official-artwork\'\].front_default) provide official
artwork URLs suitable for cards.

# 8) GraphQL Variant (optional)

\- Use persisted operations (hash/registry) in production; block ad‑hoc
queries at edge.\
- Apply complexity/depth/time budgets; resolver batching (dataloaders)
where you wrap REST.\
- Per‑field cache hints; tag‑based invalidation; error masking +
correlation IDs.\
- Note: beta endpoint can change---treat as experimental and pin a
schema snapshot.

# 9) UX Wireframes & Interface Patterns

Discover (Grid + Filters) --- Desktop:\
• Top bar: Global search (name/ID), type filter chips (Fire, Water...),
gen dropdown, sort (Dex #, A‑Z), favorites toggle\
• Grid: virtualized tiles with thumbnail (official artwork), name, dex
#, type badges; infinite scroll\
• Hover/focus: quick stats (HP/ATK/DEF), primary type color accent\
• Footer: data freshness timestamp; attribution: "Data © PokeAPI"

Discover --- Mobile (bottom sheet):\
• Search at top; sticky filter chips; results in a draggable bottom
sheet (peek/half/full)\
• Pull‑to‑refresh; infinite scroll; offline cache shows last results
(greyed)

Detail View:\
• Header: name, dex #, type badges; favorite toggle; share\
• Gallery: official artwork + sprites; pinch/zoom on mobile\
• Tabs/sections: Stats (radar chart), Abilities, Moves (filters by
type/category/power), Evolution chain (horizontal flow), Matchups
(strengths/weaknesses), Flavor text (species)\
• Actions: Copy link, open in PokeAPI docs (dev), compare (adds to
compare tray)

Compare View:\
• Two‑column (desktop) or swipeable (mobile) comparison: base stats,
types, abilities, move overlaps\
• Export/share comparison snapshot

States & A11y:\
• Skeleton tiles; clear empty states; quota banner with cached fallback\
• Full keyboard support; ARIA live for filter results; WCAG AA contrast;
RTL‑ready\
• i18n for species flavor text language and unit formats

# 10) Data & Caching Strategy

\- Long‑lived (12--24h): species, types, moves metadata; Medium (1--6h):
large lists, evolution chains; Short (5--30m): UI search results;
revalidate on demand.\
- Keys include tenant/user (if personalized), filters, limit/offset; tag
caches to clear projections when required.\
- Precompute hot projections (e.g., type‑to‑matchups) and store in Redis
for instant reads.

# 11) Deployment & Ops

\- Stateless services on Kubernetes/ECS with autoscaling; Multi‑AZ;
optional multi‑region\
- Blue/green + canary deploys with feature flags; automated rollback on
SLO breach\
- Disaster recovery with tested restores and game‑days; explicit
RPO/RTO\
- CI/CD: typecheck, unit/integration/e2e tests; SAST/DAST;
dep/container/IaC scans; signed artifacts; SBOM\
- Observability: OTel end‑to‑end; dashboards for op latency p50/p95/p99,
error rate, saturation; SIEM for security events
