Pok√©mon Contests Module UI Design

Pok√©mon Contests are special performance competitions (introduced in Generation III) held in Contest Halls, where Coordinators showcase a single Pok√©mon in one of five categories ‚Äì Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, or Toughness Ôøº.  Each contest consists of two phases: an Introduction Round and a Talent (Appeal) Round Ôøº Ôøº.  In the Introduction Round, a Pok√©mon is judged on its relevant contest stat (a ‚Äúcondition‚Äù) for that category Ôøº.  In the Talent Round, each Pok√©mon takes turns using special appeal moves to earn hearts; moves that match the contest‚Äôs category excite the audience and add bonus hearts Ôøº Ôøº.  The final winner is the Pok√©mon with the highest combined score from both rounds Ôøº Ôøº.  For example, if the contest is a Beauty contest, the Pok√©mon‚Äôs Beauty condition stat is used in round one, and in round two ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù moves (like Heart Stamp) score extra points.

A key mechanic is the Pok√©block system for raising contest stats.  Each Pok√©block color corresponds to one condition Ôøº: Blue raises Beauty, Green Cleverness, Red Coolness, Pink Cuteness, and Yellow Toughness (Rainbow blocks raise all stats).  Feeding a Pok√©block of the matching color boosts that stat before the contest Ôøº.  (In Generation III games, holding a matching-colored contest Scarf gives an additional +20 bonus to that stat Ôøº.)  In our UI, we can visualize this with a cute Pok√©block kit graphic or chart ‚Äì for example, displaying colored block icons with labels, so users understand which condition each color affects Ôøº.

Contest rounds and appeals. In the Introduction Round (left screen above), each Pok√©mon‚Äôs condition stat is evaluated ‚Äì the audience claps or shows hearts based on how high the stat is Ôøº.  Our UI could simulate this with a bar or star meter that fills according to the Pok√©mon‚Äôs stat. Next comes the Talent Round (the screenshot above), where contestants perform appeals.  Each Pok√©mon uses up to five turns of moves, and moves matching the contest category excite the crowd Ôøº Ôøº.  In the example above, using a Cuteness move in a Cuteness contest would light up the Excite Meter (top-left) and yield extra hearts. Performing recognized move combinations (contest combos) gives bonus hearts Ôøº, but repeating the same move twice in a row will bore the audience and deduct hearts Ôøº. Our UI can animate this: e.g., show stars or hearts popping up with each successful appeal, and decrease if a move is repeated.

The Excite Meter (shown above) fills as matching-category appeals are used Ôøº. When it fills completely, the performing Pok√©mon unleashes a flashy ‚ÄúSpectacular Talent‚Äù for bonus points Ôøº. In the UI, we would show a meter or progress bar (with star or heart icons) that lights up on each matching move; when full, trigger a fun animation (confetti, sparkles, etc.) to celebrate the Spectacular Talent. For example, a star icon could light up each turn, and once it‚Äôs filled, show a short sparkling animation to emphasize the big scoring move Ôøº.  This reinforces the game mechanic in a cute, entertaining way.

Kawaii UI and Entertainment Features
 ‚Ä¢ Pastel color scheme and icons: Use soft, bright colors (e.g. light blue for Cool, pink for Cute) and rounded, cartoonish fonts.  Include cute icons like hearts, stars, ribbons, or bows for each category. For instance, a heart icon for the Cute category or a star for Cool. These elements should animate lightly (e.g. a heart might ‚Äúpop‚Äù on correct appeals) to keep things lively.
 ‚Ä¢ Animated feedback: When the player makes a good move, show playful animations: bouncing heart emojis, sparkling stars, or confetti bursts.  On failure or penalties, a cute ‚Äúboo‚Äù cloud or sleepy icon can appear. For example, after a successful appeal, small hearts might float up from the Pok√©mon; if the same move is repeated, a little yawning face could pop up to indicate boredom.
 ‚Ä¢ Category-themed decorations: Each contest category panel could have thematic decorations (e.g. flowers for Beauty, cute paw prints for Cuteness, a tiny boxing glove or mountain silhouette for Toughness). Even subtle background patterns (ribbons, stars) reinforce the theme.
 ‚Ä¢ Gamified tips and humor: Include helper text or tooltips with kawaii personality. For example, show a tip like ‚Äúüí° Tip: Don‚Äôt use the same move twice ‚Äì the crowd will get bored and you‚Äôll lose hearts Ôøº!‚Äù or ‚Äú‚ú® Wow! That move impressed the judges!‚Äù.  Use friendly language and emojis to make it fun. The UI could also display short Pok√©mon-style dialogues or memes after rounds (e.g. ‚ÄúPikachu is electric-ally amazing in Cool contests!‚Äù).
 ‚Ä¢ Consistency with existing app: Follow design patterns from the Top 50 module (cards, modals, typography) so the new page feels native. Use rounded containers, drop shadows, or a tabbed layout similarly. Ensure mobile-responsive design: layouts reflow cleanly on small screens and buttons are touch-friendly.

Next.js Integration and Data
 ‚Ä¢ Component structure: Build as a functional React component (or page) in Next.js (e.g. pages/contests.js or components/ContestModule.jsx). Use React state (e.g. useState) to track contest stats (current hearts, meter fill).
 ‚Ä¢ Data loading: Embed static contest data (e.g. Pok√©block mappings, move lists) as JSON or JS objects. You can use getStaticProps or import a data file to supply moves, categories, and contest rules. Alternatively, fetch from an external Pok√©mon API if available.
 ‚Ä¢ Interactive elements: Use event handlers for game actions (e.g. clicking a Pok√©block to boost a stat, selecting an appeal move). Manage state transitions for rounds. For example, after boosting stats and submitting, move to the Talent Round view and allow selecting moves.
 ‚Ä¢ Styling: Apply CSS (or a library like Tailwind, Chakra, or styled-jsx) to achieve the kawaii look. Use components for buttons and icons, reusing any icon set in the app (heart icons, star icons, etc.). Include simple CSS animations (like @keyframes for confetti or a ‚Äúpulse‚Äù effect on hearts).
 ‚Ä¢ Responsive layout: Ensure the module looks good on desktop and mobile. For example, on small screens stack the contest category icons vertically, and use collapsible sections if needed.
 ‚Ä¢ App consistency: Align with the app‚Äôs existing Next.js conventions. For example, if the Top 50 feature uses a grid of cards, use a similar grid to display contest categories or move lists. Follow the same font and color tokens defined in the theme for consistency.

Codex Prompt

Write a Next.js (React) component or page for a **Pok√©mon Contests** module with a *kawaii* (cute, pastel-themed) design and playful animations. The UI should:

- Display the five contest categories (Cool, Beauty, Cute, Clever, Tough). Each category should have its own icon and color theme (for example, blue for Cool, pink for Cute) and a brief description of that contest stat.
- Include an interactive Introduction Round and Talent Round simulation. For example, allow the user to "feed" colored Pok√©blocks to the Pok√©mon: show Red/Blue/Pink/Green/Yellow blocks that raise Coolness/Beauty/Cuteness/Cleverness/Toughness, respectively. Display the Pok√©mon‚Äôs condition stat before the contest and update it when blocks are fed.
- Show contest rank progression (Normal ‚ñ∂ Super ‚ñ∂ Hyper ‚ñ∂ Master) and mention any rewards (like Ribbons) for winning each rank.
- Simulate the Talent (Appeal) round: provide a list of sample appeal moves for the Pok√©mon. Emphasize that using a move matching the contest category excites the crowd. For instance, add an ‚ÄúExcite Meter‚Äù graphic (with hearts or stars) that fills up when the player uses a correct-category move. When the meter fills, trigger a small celebration (e.g. sparkles and a ‚ÄúSpectacular Talent‚Äù message).
- Display scores as hearts and stars: e.g. hearts gained from appeals, stars from the Introduction Round. Animate these elements (hearts flying up, stars glowing) for feedback.
- Include helpful hints or tooltips. For example, show a tip like ‚ÄúTip: Using the same move twice will bore the audience and lose points‚Äù when applicable.
- Use a pastel color palette, rounded fonts, and cute icons (hearts, stars, ribbons, confetti) for the kawaii aesthetic. Add fun text or emojis in status messages (e.g. ‚ÄúAmazing move! üéâ‚Äù).
- Structure the component with React state and effects. Use `useState` to manage the Pok√©mon‚Äôs condition and excite meter. Fetch or import contest data in `getStaticProps` if needed. Ensure the code follows Next.js conventions (functional components, CSS modules or styling library) and matches the app‚Äôs design patterns (like the existing Top 50 module).
