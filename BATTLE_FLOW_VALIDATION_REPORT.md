### ✅ Battle System Architecture

#### 1. Battle Creation Flow
```typescript
// Cloud Function: createBattleWithTeams
- Validates team data
- Creates battle in Firebase Realtime Database
- Sets up initial battle state
- Returns battle ID for client navigation
```

#### 2. Real-time Data Synchronization
```typescript
// Firebase Realtime Database Structure
/battles/{battleId}/
├── meta/                    // Battle metadata
│   ├── players/            // Player information
│   ├── phase/              // Current battle phase
│   ├── turn/               // Current turn number
│   └── version/            // Version for conflict resolution
├── public/                 // Public battle state
│   ├── {playerId}/         // Player-specific public data
│   └── field/              // Field effects and hazards
├── private/                // Private player data
│   └── {playerId}/         // Private team data, PP, etc.
└── turns/                  // Turn history
    └── {turnNumber}/
        ├── choices/        // Player choices
        ├── resolution/     // Turn resolution
        └── replacements/   // Team switches
```

#### 3. Move Handling System
```typescript
// Move Submission Flow
1. Client submits move choice to /battles/{bid}/turns/{turn}/choices/{uid}
2. onChoiceCreate Cloud Function triggers
3. Function validates both players have submitted choices
4. Function processes battle turn using battle engine
5. Function updates battle state in database
6. Clients receive real-time updates via Firebase listeners
```

#### 4. Team Switching System
```typescript
// Team Switch Flow
1. Client submits replacement to /battles/{bid}/turns/{turn}/replacements/{uid}
2. onReplacementCreate Cloud Function triggers
3. Function processes team switch
4. Function applies entry hazards and abilities
5. Function updates battle state
6. Clients receive real-time updates
```
