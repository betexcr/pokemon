2. **Navigate between tips** using Previous/Next buttons or arrow keys
3. **Jump to specific tips** by clicking the progress dots
4. **Close the assistant** using the X button or Escape key
5. **Let tips auto-advance** or navigate manually

## Customization

### Adding New Tips
To add tips for a new page, update the `HELP_TIPS` object in `HelpAssistant.tsx`:

```typescript
'/new-page': [
  {
    id: 'tip_id',
    title: 'Tip Title',
    content: 'Helpful tip content here...',
    duration: 4 // Auto-advance duration in seconds
  }
]
```

### Modifying Appearance
- **PokÃ©mon mascot**: Change the image paths in the component
- **Colors**: Update Tailwind classes for different themes
- **Animations**: Modify CSS classes for different effects
- **Positioning**: Adjust the fixed positioning classes

### Behavior Customization

- **Auto-advance**: Modify or disable the auto-advance feature
- **Tip persistence**: Adjust how tips are remembered across sessions

## Assets Used

The Help Assistant uses PokÃ©mon Mystery Dungeon (PMD) assets:
- **Pikachu portraits**: `/assets/pmd/0025/portrait/Normal.png`
- **Happy expression**: `/assets/pmd/0025/portrait/Happy.png`

## Browser Support

- **Modern browsers**: Full support with animations and interactions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- **Mobile devices**: Touch-friendly with responsive design

## Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size impact

The Help Assistant provides a delightful and helpful user experience while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility standards.
